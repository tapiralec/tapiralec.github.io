Context-dependent memory studies have indicated that olfaction, the sense of smell, has a special odor memory that can significantly improve recall in some cases. Virtual reality (VR), which has been investigated as a training tool, could feasibly benefit from odor memory by incorporating olfactory stimuli.  There have been a few studies on this concept for semantic learning, but not for procedural training. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the effects of olfaction on the transfer of knowledge from training to next-day execution for building a complex LEGO jet-plane model. Our results indicate that the pleasantness of an odor significantly affects training transfer more than whether the encoding and recall contexts match.
