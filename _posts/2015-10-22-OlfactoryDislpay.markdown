Olfaction, the sense of smell, is an important perceptual function. It has been shown to enhance the quality of life and to facilitate memory recall. However, despite its importance and potential benefits, olfaction is often neglected when creating immersive media experiences (IMEs). The probable reason is that olfactory displays are not readily available. We have developed a reproducible olfactory display that is simple and affordable to make olfactory displays more available. More importantly, we have conducted three exploratory studies on the effects of olfaction. The results of these studies indicate that olfaction is a nuanced sense that can have both positive and negative effects on user experiences. Hence, further research is needed to better understand and design for olfaction in IMEs.
